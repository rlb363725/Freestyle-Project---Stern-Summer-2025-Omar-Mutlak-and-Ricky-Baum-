## College Football Matchup Analyzer

This tool compares two FBS teams' season stats using data from the [CollegeFootballData API](https://collegefootballdata.com/), predicts a score based on offensive/defensive yardage, and visualizes a stat comparison using Plotly.

### Features

* Retrieves live team stats from the CollegeFootballData API
* Predicts scores based on total offensive and defensive yards
* Forecasts each team's offensive yards and defensive yards allowed
* Visualizes side-by-side stat comparisons using Plotly
* Displays predicted scores with win probabilities in a Plotly bar chart
* Command-line interface for interactive use
* Includes automated tests using Pytest

### How It Works

1. You input two FBS teams and a season year.
2. The app fetches season-long team stats from the API.
3. It calculates predicted scores using total yards gained and allowed.
4. Bar charts visualize stat comparisons and predicted scores with win probabilities using Plotly.
